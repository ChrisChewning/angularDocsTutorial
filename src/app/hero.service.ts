//Observable is one of the key classes in the RxJS library. Angular's HttpClient methods return RxJS Observables.

//RxJS (Reactive Extensions Library for JS) is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code


@Injectable({  //annotates the class w. the @Injectable decorator. unlike React you don't have to say Class. It just is. So you're already in the class and you use the @Injectable decorator that comes with Angular. Now the HeroService class (from hero.service.ts) will provide an injectable service and its own injected dependencies.
  providedIn: 'root',
  //this ^ registers the provider, which is needed to 'create or deliver a service.' This one instantiates the class to provide the service.
  //2. this is at the root level. there's now 'a single, shared instance of HeroService and injects into any class that asks for it. Registering the provider in the @Injectable metadata also allows Angular to optimize an app by removing the service if it turns out not to be used after all.'

export class HeroService {

  constructor(private messageService: MessageService) { }


  getHeroes(): Observable<Hero[]> { //emits a single value. the array of mock heroes from mock-heroes.ts. //THIS IS THE HeroService.getHeroes method.

    // TODO: send the message _after_ fetching the heroes
    this.messageService.add('HeroService: fetched heroes');
    return of(HEROES);
  }
}



//NOTE: The @Injectable() decorator accepts a metadata object for the service, the same way the @Component() decorator did for your component classes.

//NOTE 2: The HeroService could get hero data from anywhereâ€”a web service, local storage, or a mock data source.
